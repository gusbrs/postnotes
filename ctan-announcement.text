## v0.3.0 (2024-10-15)

### Added
- Provide `multiple` option, with functionality akin the the same named option
  from `footmisc`.
- Provide (experimental) support for PDF tagging. For this, the required LaTeX
  kernel version was bumped to 2024-06-01. Tagging support requires
  `testphase=phase-III` (`phase-II` with `listenv=none`).
